### Key points:
• The project utilizes LSTM networks to facilitate basin-wide groundwater level forecasting from time series data.

• It employs three methods: independent training, training with averaged data, and a transfer learning approach.

• Achieved superior performance metrics (NSE and R2) showing the potential of transfer learning-based DL methods for forecasting.
